Throughout history, humans have made countless inventions, from the first stone weapon to the lateset quantum computers. After the next revolutionary innovations come up, the old ones are removed,
because we are always trying to build bigger, better and stronger. Recently, as we all know has been a great advancements in the field of AI which is apparent through ChatGPT. But should we
stay on what was built first, or perhaphs move on to something better?

I say... LETS GO FOR IT!

# Introducing BetterGPT

After years of hardwork, failures, successes, and innovations, there's finally a product made to talk to humans using natural language. Although ChatGPT came out first and took over the news headlines,
since it was made by top class engineers around the world in a highly sophisticated facility with access to premium computers. There was a middle schooler working in his 11x11 feet room on a quad-core
CPU computer since 3 years before ChatGPT, inspired by Iron Man, who dreamed to one day create a technology which could interact with humans the same way humans do.

Even though it arrived a bit late, it is finally here! And I am excited to tell that it is 90% the capability of ChatGPT and believe it or not, this script has been written by the BetterGPT model.
So don't wait and get on something better: [BetterGPT](https://bettergpt.crystal.com/)
